# RefineByFactor.glf
# ========================================================================================
# Written by Steve Karman

# Script for performing automatic mesh refinement by a prescribed factor (User defined below)
# The assumptions are:
#    1. Unstructured domains (and optionally a single block).
#    2. Basically developed in support of meshes created by GeomToMesh.glf and QuiltToSurfMesh.glf
#    3. The factor can be greater than 1 (refine) or less than 1 (coarsen), but not equal to 0 or negative.
#
#   The script will:
#   Scale the dimensions of each connector by the factor.
#   Change the end point spacing on each connector by 1 / factor.
#   All TRexConditions will be changed by 1 / factor. 
#   The domains will be refined or initialized.
#   If sources exist the beginning and ending spacing values will be changed by 1 / factor.
#   If a volume mesh exists and uses TRex the growth rate will
#   be changed by taking the current growth rate to the power of (1 / factor).
#   Then, if it exists, the single unstructured block will be initialized.
#
#   NOTE: No files will be read or written. It works on the mesh in memory and does not export it.
